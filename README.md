# Programming-Assessments
This file contains the code for four of my assessments taken while studying at the University of Glasgow, three for the first semester 
'Programming' module, and one for the 'Advanced Programming' module. All are written with Java.  

AssEx1 2376095R contains the first assessment, a program allowing users to process a series of sales or returns for a fictional
wine company. It calculates a total price for a transaction - including calculating an 80% cost for returns - and returns a receipt of the
final cost for the user. Grade: A1

AE2 2376095R Contains the second Programming assessment, a program using a cypher to code or decode messages based upon keywords the 
user supplies. The program makes use of the MonoAlphabetic and Vignere cypher, and codes or decodes based upon key letters at the end 
of the message being manipulated - P for encoding, and C for decoding. The program writes the new message to a txt file for the user.
Grade: A1

AE3 2376095R contains the final Programming assessment. This is a program utilising the Java Swing Framework to create an interactive 
graph based upon data supplied by a user in an Excel file. Grade: A2

AE1 Contains the assessment for the Advanced Programming module. This module was designed to test our knowledge of Threads by simulating 
a single track of a railway, composed of tracks and stations with different capacities for trains. These stations ad their capacities 
are randomised upon starting the program. Trains of two different speeds are placed upon the start of the track in a random order, with 
faster trains able to over-take the slower ones wherever possible. Grade: A1
